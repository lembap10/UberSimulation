CSCI3081W class project
## Description  
 This project was created throughout the semester in 3081W.  
 The front end parts (Javascript) to this project were written mainly by course staff, but an understanding of its content was required. The back end (Written in C++) was worked on througout the semester, and could interact with the front end using the facade pattern.  
 Notable elements of the written back-end (related to Design Patterns), most items here are located in libs/transit:  
 - Using Strategy Pattern to assign entities with various pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra's, Depth-First Seach, and Astar Search) as user desires
 - Using Factory Pattern to create entities (Drone or Robot)
 - Using the Decorator Pattern to add a celeberation to the robot upon trip completion.
  
Instructions on how to run project are in the readme in the project file.
